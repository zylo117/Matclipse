    <h1>Configuration</h1>
    <h2>Preferences</h2>
    <p>Currently there are three preference pages: "Matlab Editor", "Export" and "Helpbrowser".</p>
    <p>Most of the options are self-explanatory, so only some of them are described in detail.</p>
    
    <h3>Export</h3>
    <p>This page shares some options with the export dialog. Each confirmed change in this dialog is stored and reappeares in the preference page.</p>
    <table cellspacing="10px">
    <tr>
      <td valign="top">Metadata</td>
      <td>This group is devided into two sections: general data and filespecific data. Since filespecific data is expacted to change between exports and general data not, only the second part is contained also in the export dialog.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top">Output Formats<br><nobr>/ export LaTeX core only</nobr></td>
      <td>If checked, the exported file will contain only the pure content in LaTeX syntax. This is everything that normally would be placed between <tt>\begin{document}</tt> and <tt>\end{document}</tt>. For example, this may be used if one exported Matlab file represents only a single chapter of a bigger LaTeX file.<br>It's not possible to generate a PDF from a core text.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top">Transformation options</td>
      <td>HTML and LaTeX output is generated by transforming an XML file via XSLT files. Here one can specify which transformation files shall be used. </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    
    <h3>Helpbrowser</h3>
    <p>Here one can define how a help browser window should appear when using Meditor's Matlab help. Further the basis URL to the Matlab help pages is specified.</p>
    
    <h2>Configuration files</h2>
    Some of Meditor's functionalities are configured by files, which are located in <tt>plugindir/config/</tt>.
    <table cellspacing="10px">
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><tt>help_funcs</tt></td>
      <td>This is a simple list of Matlab functions (like <tt>matlab_funcs</tt>) that have their own help page. Furthermore the helppage's name has to equal the function's name. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><tt>helpfileexceptions.xml</tt></td>
      <td>This is a table of special Matlab expressions (e.g. operators), which links from an expression to its help page.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><tt>latexpic.template</tt></td>
      <td>To include equations in HTML exports, each equation is transformed into a graphic by using LaTeX. This file is a template for this purpose. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><tt>matlab_funcs</tt></td>
      <td>As a simple list of strings this file defines which expressions are Matlab functions. This file may be generated automatically by a tool developed at ITPCP.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><tt>toolbox_funcs</tt></td>
      <td>This file is similar to <tt>matlab_funcs</tt> but lists toolbox functions.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td valign="top"><tt>*.xsl</tt></td>
      <td>The XSLT files to use for generating HTML and LaTeX output.</td>
    </tr>
    </table>
